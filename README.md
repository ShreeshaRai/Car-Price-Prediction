This project uses regression models to predict the price of used cars based on various attributes such as brand, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and number of previous owners. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature encoding, model comparison, and evaluation using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score. The best model is saved using joblib and can be reused for future predictions.
